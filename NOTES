to get the db connector working:

- add /usr/local/mysql/bin to path, to get mysql_config
- pip install sqlalchemy
- pip install MySQL-python
- ln /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.8.dylib to /usr/lib (use sudo)

insert into word_attributes (attribute_id, word_id, value)
values (1, 49, 'DIS'), (3, 49, 'BLATTS'), (5, 49, 'STUFF')
on duplicate key update value=values(value);

now we need to handle the case where a quiz has 1 part of speech but multiple attributes
- can't present a quiz that doesn't have all the attribute values filled in.

as a rule, transactions should only be in view functions - subordinate functions
that hit the database should not declare their own transactions.
