in add-word, the names for the fields shouldn't be the text that 
is displayed - should have keys that are different from names

adding a word to dict that is already there should populate the form,
submit should update if necessary.  we can do that by setting
the values of the input fields

can we case-fold in a template?

styles to govern the size of text input fields
